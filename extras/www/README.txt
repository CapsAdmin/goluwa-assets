This is Strongly Typed, a new site template with a minimal, semi-retro
look (inspired by old instruction manuals) and, as you might guess from its
name, a strong emphasis on type. It's fully responsive, built on HTML5/CSS3,
and includes styling for all basic page elements. Demo images* are courtesy of 
regularjane, an incredibly talented photographer friend of mine. Be sure to
check out more of her work over at deviantART:

* Not included with this download (replaced with generic placeholder images).
I only have permission to use her work in my own onsite demos so do NOT download
or use any of her photos without her explicit permission.

As usual, feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly
encouraged :)
